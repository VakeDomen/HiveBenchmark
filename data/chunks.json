    ", most users changed it to Google . And when people set up a Windows device for the first time they frequently sidestep the Microsoft default — “ Google ” was the number one search query on Bing in 2021 — despite Microsoft making that very annoying to do . This is a compelling point , and many of us will be well accustomed to dodging all of Microsoft ’ s pleading while trying to get Chrome and Google set as defaults whenever we set up a new PC . But all of these arguments do ignore the fact that Google and its competitors are not on an even playing field . The question remains , why do users prefer Google ? And if the answer , as Walker says , is that Google is simply better , the question becomes whether that ’ s down to its scale , its longevity , its ubiquity and all the user data it sucks up , which no other company could possibly match . For the US , which has to prove that Google somehow broke the law to achieve the status quo , this legal case could be an uphill battle . But for the rest of us , it offers a rare opportunity for some insight into what the tech giant does with its enormous market share . Is it still focused on being the best ? Or , as has been alleged , does it use its ubiquity to squeeze us for money even at the expense of product quality ? How ‘ organic ’ are Google ’ s results ? This month , Wired posted an opinion article by lawyer and privacy advocate Megan Gray , which alleged that Google had accidentally revealed during the trial that it manipulates people ’ s search queries for maximum ad revenue . The example given was replacing a search for “ children ’ s clothing ” with “ NIKOLAI-brand kidswear ” . Loading Google rejected this in very strong terms , saying the piece was misleading and inaccurate while denying ever altering search terms . Wired removed the article for not meeting its standards , but the degree to which it was shared on social media and boosted in write-ups at other outlets shows just how willing people are to accept foul play on Google ’ s part . A suspicion of privacy invasion and inappropriate data handling follows the company at all times . Grey herself is a former vice-president at DuckDuckGo , a privacy-focused company founded explicitly to counter giants such as Google . She admits that she may have misinterpreted the evidence , but maintains that Google manipulates Search to maximise ad revenue . So what does Google say ? In a post on X , Google ’ s official search liaison , Danny Sullivan , said ad systems do not affect the organic results , i.e .",
    "have misinterpreted the evidence , but maintains that Google manipulates Search to maximise ad revenue . So what does Google say ? In a post on X , Google ’ s official search liaison , Danny Sullivan , said ad systems do not affect the organic results , i.e . the list of blue links in search results that are not sponsored . “ Ad keyword matching is a long-standing and well-known process that is designed to connect people to relevant ads . A separate process , which has nothing to do with ads , is used to match organic results to a query , ” he said . “ It ’ s no secret that Google Search looks beyond the specific words in a query to better understand their meaning ... If you make a spelling mistake , or search for a term that ’ s not on a page but where the page has a close synonym , or if you aren ’ t even sure exactly how to search for something , our meaning matching systems help. ” It is true that some search queries result in more ads than others , and what ads you get can vary wildly depending on your request , which is the result of the keyword matching Google uses to sell ads . But Google denies pushing users towards the most monetisable subjects . Similarly , it ’ s also pretty common to see people complaining on the internet with some variation of “ Google Search was a lot better 10 years ago ” , which could absolutely be true . But it would be a stretch to assume that ’ s because of the company ’ s monetisation practices , when there ’ s a much simpler explanation . In 2013 , people were creating around 9 ZB of data every year ( that ’ s nine zettabytes , or nine trillion gigabytes ) , which Google had to index constantly , whereas in 2023 it ’ s more like 120 ZB . And not a whole lot of that is static websites like it was a decade ago , it ’ s live information that may be nested within various services and apps . What really happens when we search ? Google has published extensive information about its Search procedures , so it ’ s not difficult to get its own take on what happens in the background when you send off a query . Google ’ s software is constantly crawling the web and updating its central index , which itself is more than 100 million gigabytes in size . When you enter a query , Search uses a few quick processes to decide the meaning of your question , including what kind of information you might be after .",
    "crawling the web and updating its central index , which itself is more than 100 million gigabytes in size . When you enter a query , Search uses a few quick processes to decide the meaning of your question , including what kind of information you might be after . Then , beyond just looking for sites with the words you typed in , the system uses machine learning to rank results according to what it thinks you ’ re looking for , prioritising high quality and easy to use sites . If you allow it , Google does bring in some information it knows about you to further refine results , including your location and web history . If you ’ re looking to turn this off , it ’ s in your Google account settings called “ Web & App Activity ” . Google says it does not infer personal information like race or religion to shape results . Loading Google works with independent “ search quality raters ” to gauge the effectiveness of its processes , and says it ran almost 900,000 quality tests in 2022 . Some critics , including Megan Grey , contend that Google uses semantic keyword matching to make searches less precise on purpose , which widens the pool of content served and increases auctions for its ads . The quality tests , then , would ensure that the systems were still returning results that were justifiably related to the input .",
    "A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law , the Sherman Act , and others , on behalf of news publishers . The case , filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle , argues that Google “ siphons off ” news publishers ’ content , their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means . It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google ’ s Search Generative Experience ( SGE ) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem . In the complaint , Helena World Chronicle , which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas , argues that Google is “ starving the free press ” by sharing publishers ’ content on Google , losing them “ billions of dollars. ” In addition to new AI technologies , the suit points to Google ’ s older question-and-answer technologies , like the “ Knowledge Graph ” launched in May 2012 , as part of the problem . “ When a user searches for information on a topic , Google displays a ‘ Knowledge Panel ’ to the right of the search results . This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database , ” the complaint states . “ Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers ’ websites — what Google calls ‘ materials shared across the web ’ —and from ‘ open source and licensed databases , ' ” it says . By 2020 , the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities . But much of the “ collective intelligence ” that Google tapped into was content “ misappropriated from Publishers , ” the complaint alleges . Other Google technologies , like “ Featured Snippets ” where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages , were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers ’ websites . More importantly , perhaps , is the suit ’ s tackling of how AI will impact publishers ’ businesses . The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal , which led with a shocking statistic . When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search , it found that 75 % of the time the AI would answer the user ’ s query without requiring a click-through to its website , losing it traffic . This could have a major impact on publishers ’ traffic going forward , as Google today drives nearly 40 % of their traffic , according to data from Similarweb . Some publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem . For example , Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training .",
    "Google today drives nearly 40 % of their traffic , according to data from Similarweb . Some publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem . For example , Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training . But overall , publishers believe they ’ ll lose somewhere between 20-40 % of their website traffic when Google ’ s AI products fully roll out , The WSJ ’ s report noted . The lawsuit reiterates this concern , claiming that Google ’ s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with “ the goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce. ” SGE , it argues , offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode , but ultimately keeps users in Google ’ s “ walled garden ” as it “ plagiarizes ” their content . Publishers also can ’ t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google ’ s general search service , GoogleBot . Plus , it says Google ’ s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included “ news , magazine and digital publications , ” citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference . ( The Post , which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI , had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data . ) The case points to other concerns , too , like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google ’ s part , by its destruction of chat messages — an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues , which Epic won . In addition to damages , the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google ’ s own and those of rivals . It also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results , among other things . The U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content . Under the terms of the deal , Google will provide $ 73.5 million ( 100 million Canadian dollars ) every year to news organizations in the country , with funds distributed based on the news outlets ’ headcount . Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved , though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August , in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law .",

The case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department ’ s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies , and references the 2020 Justice Department ’ s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising ( which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit ) . “ The anticompetitive effects of Google ’ s scheme cause profound harm to competition , to consumers , to labor , and to a democratic free press , ” reads an announcement posted to the website of the law firm handling the case , Hausfeld . “ Plaintiff Helena World Chronicle , LLC invokes the Sherman Act and Clayton Act to seek class-wide monetary and injunctive relief to restore and ensure competition for digital news and reference publishing and set up guardrails to preserve a free marketplace of ideas in the new era of artificial intelligence , ” it states . A Google spokesperson offered a statement on the lawsuit , saying “ This lawsuit is meritless . People have many ways to access information and news content today – through publishers ’ websites , dedicated apps , social media platforms , print papers and more . Google links people to publishers ’ websites more than 24 billion times each month – at no cost to them. ” The complaint is available below . Helena World Chronicle , LLC v.

    "For 59 minutes , the story of Week 13 's 'Sunday Night Football ' clash was Jordan Love . The first-year starter continued to showcase his evolution as a big-game player , dicing up Kansas City 's All-World defense with incredible efficiency . Then came the blown calls . The Packers edged past the Chiefs on Sunday , beneficiaries of another Love masterpiece — an increasingly common sight in the 2023 season . But it was the game 's final moments that drew the most intrigue , mostly because of their incredulous nature . Jonathan Owens was whistled for an unnecessary roughness that never was on the game 's final drive , penalized for crashing into a scrambling Patrick Mahomes on the field of play . Soon after , Marquez Valdes-Scantling was seemingly impeded by Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine on a streak play , an unabashed pass interference call in most circumstances . The umpires fell silent . If that were n't enough , Owens then barged into Kelce 's back on the final play of the game and Mahomes ' Hail Mary tumbled onto the turf . And like the previous play , the contact went unrecognized by the zebras . It was a sorry end to an enthralling contest . Love and Mahomes dueled like gladiators , each painting pictures atop the verdant green canvas . Love was the better man on the day . He completed 25-of-36 passes for 267 yards , three touchdowns and no interceptions . It 's his fourth game with three touchdowns and no interceptions this year . That 's tied for most in the league .

    "'T is the season for horrors , and the Jaguars left New Orleans surviving a late scare against the Saints on `` Thursday Night Football . '' ' Jacksonville improved to 5-2 on the season , as Doug Pederson 's crew held off a late comeback attempt from New Orleans , emerging with a 31-24 victory . The win pushes the Jaguars ' winning streak to four games , while the loss dropped the Saints ' record to 3-4 . The Jaguars controlled a majority of the game , getting out to an early lead in the first half and entering the fourth quarter up 24-9 . At the time , the Saints offense was completely out of sync , as quarterback Derek Carr had just thrown a pick-six to Foye Oluokun and was struggling to connect with any of his key weapons , outside of running back Alvin Kamara . However , Trevor Lawrence and the Jags let the Saints stick around , failing to put away the opposition . It led to two fourth quarter touchdowns by New Orleans that tied the game with less than six minutes to go , and the momentum had fully shifted at Caesers SuperDome to the home side . That was until Christian Kirk came through for the Jaguars . After the two sides exchanged punts , the wide receiver broke loose for a 44-yard touchdown , re-taking the lead for Jacksonville with 3:08 left to go . The Saints nearly tied the game up in the final seconds of the game . Tight end Foster Moreau had a touchdown in his fingertips on third-and-goal , but he could not come up with the catch . A pass to Chris Olave on fourth down was broken up , as the Jags held on for the win .

Please try again later { { /verifyErrors } } Longtime Hollywood couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith sent shockwaves around the world this week when the Red Table Talk host revealed that she and the actor have been separated since 2016 . Both Jada and Will have previously doubled down on their stance against getting a divorce , but her recent reveal about their lengthy separation poses a new question : When should couples just get a divorce ? In an interview with People on 10 October , Jada shared that during the 2022 Academy Awards - when Will slapped Chris Rock after he cracked a joke about Jada ’ s appearance - the pair had actually been separated for six years . “ We ’ ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together , ” she explained , while promoting her new memoir , Worthy . “ We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us. ” She praised her and Will ’ s two children - Jaden , 25 , and Willow , 22 - for being her “ little gurus ” throughout this time , noting that they ’ ve taught her “ a deep sense of self-acceptance ” . Although the married couple are not living together , she insisted that their marriage has never been an open one , as she and Will have “ eliminated the chance of betrayal ” while going on to live their “ separate lives ” . This isn ’ t the first time that Jada and Will have taken some time apart from each other . During a 2020 episode of her Facebook Watch series , Red Table Talk , Jada disclosed that while she and Will were separated amicably , she had a relationship with singer August Alsina , describing their involvement as an “ entanglement ” . Throughout their marriage of 26 years , the A-listers have made it clear that divorce was never in the cards . Jada furthered that belief during a preview for an interview with Today ’ s Hoda Kotb , which aired on 13 October . “ I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce , ” she said . “ We will work through , whatever .",
    "during a preview for an interview with Today ’ s Hoda Kotb , which aired on 13 October . “ I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce , ” she said . “ We will work through , whatever . I just haven ’ t been able to break that promise. ” Of course , outsiders aren ’ t fully aware of the “ heavy-duty work ” that Jada and Will have done throughout their marriage . But the amount of time they ’ ve spent separated begs questions about all long-term relationships in general . When is it the time for couples to throw the towel in ? And when should separations ultimately become the end result that couples have tried to avoid : divorce . While there ’ s never a simple answer to the question , relationship experts have discovered the signs that it ’ s time to keep fighting for the one you love , or time to let them go . Speaking to The Independent , New York City-based relationship expert Susan Winter highlighted the jarring differences between a separation and divorce . When it comes to divorce , Hollywood couples can notably get involved in lengthy legal processes , from dividing financial assets to creating child custody agreements . Although we don ’ t know the terms of Jada and Will ’ s separation , Winter believes that they ’ re showcasing a non-conventional relationship that ’ s not familiar to the public . Will and Jada ’ s dynamic includes living in separate homes , but it could be a choice that ’ s for the better . “ It ’ s an LAT partnership , meaning ‘ living apart together , ’ ” Winter said . “ While everybody is at a different point as to why they are doing this , the centre point is the same : the preservation of the partnership is paramount . Separations can also be beneficial if both individuals are working on themselves and have the mutual goal of reuniting , or making their relationship better . However , that doesn ’ t necessarily mean that their improved relationship will result in them living together again. ” On the other hand , dating coach Jacob Lucas - who ’ s based in the UK - acknowledged that not all separations end in resolutions . When couples opt not to live together anymore , it could create an emotional disconnect between them . If a lack of connection occurred before couples separated , that separation doesn ’ t necessarily make the issues go away . In fact , Lucas believes that in these situations , couples could also be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability .

    "the issues go away . In fact , Lucas believes that in these situations , couples could also be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability . ( AFP via Getty Images ) “ They ’ re not resolving their problems , they ’ re rescheduling them . So , if you separate from someone , but you live in a separate house and you ’ re still together , it seems to me you ’ re just not letting go of the past because you want to stick to what ’ s familiar , ” he claimed . “ People stick to what they know , and it ’ s like you have a tether to that person . Your brain ’ s like : ‘ I can not let go of them because I am scared of the unknown. ’ I don ’ t think I ’ ve ever seen a couple separate and come back again. ” It ’ s unclear whether Jada and Will plan on ending their separation and living in the same home again . However , the couple have been candid about their plans to not get a divorce . Jada previously recalled that when she first decided to get married to Will in 1997 , it would be for the long haul . “ I told Will from the gate , I said let me tell you something : ‘ If you marry me , know this : we ’ re gon na be together . We ’ re going to be under the same roof , ’ ” she said during a 2018 episode of Red Table Talk . “ For me personally , I ’ m not mature enough to have a divorce , I ’ m just not . I don ’ t think I would ever be mature enough , I don ’ t. ” Will - who divorced his first wife , Sheree Zampino , in 1994 - has also shared similar sentiments about making his marriage with Jada work . Back in 2006 , the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star first explained to MTV News that divorce wasn ’ t an option for him and his second wife . “ With Jada , I stood up in front of God and said : ‘ Til death do us part , ’ ” he said at the time . “ So there are two possible outcomes . One , we are going to be together ‘ til death , or two , I am dead. ” Speaking to The Independent , Lucas noted that while it ’ s important for both parties to be invested in their relationships , promising not to get a divorce could spark feelings of resentment down the line .",
    "together ‘ til death , or two , I am dead. ” Speaking to The Independent , Lucas noted that while it ’ s important for both parties to be invested in their relationships , promising not to get a divorce could spark feelings of resentment down the line . Fans aren ’ t fully aware of why Will and Jada made that promise to each other , but the dating coach believes that an agreement like theirs could create a false narrative about a divorce . Jada Pinkett Smith y Will Smith ( Getty Images ) “ Getting divorced shouldn ’ t feel like a taboo because people grow apart and that ’ s fine , ” he explained . “ People get stuck in relationships because of their friends and family or societal pressure , and they worry about getting divorced . They think a divorce has a stigma to its name , which it doesn ’ t , and they push aside the fact that they still essentially feel trapped with someone they don ’ t want to be with. ” Perhaps one of the reasons why Jada and Will have promised not to get a divorce is because they also agreed not to sign a prenuptial agreement . In an interview with Parade published on 13 October , Jada explained it was her special connection with Will that encouraged them not to sign a prenup before getting married . “ I feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes , recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other : ‘ No matter what , we ’ re going to figure it out and that ’ s why we don ’ t need a prenup , because I ’ m making a promise that divorce won ’ t be necessary , that we will figure this out , ’ ” she recalled . “ And we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty ; it was just sitting on a log in his mother ’ s backyard , and going : ‘ Hey ’ - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together. ” Although they ’ ve made their dedication to each other quite clear , there have been some grey areas over the last seven years about the terms of Will and Jada ’ s separation . In 2020 , Jada made headlines when she revealed in a Red Table Talk episode with her husband that she had a relationship with Alsina . She explained that she and her husband were “ separated amicably ” when the romance occurred , which had not been disclosed to the press at the time .",

As the Girls Trip star recalled that she “ got into a different kind of entanglement with August , ” she was prompted by Will to confirm it “ was a relationship , absolutely. ” Outsiders are now aware that Jada and Will have been separated since 2016 , but the timeline of her relationship with Alsina is still fuzzy . Indeed , the terms of Will and Jada ’ s separation are still unknown to the public and in some cases , having separate relationships can give couples the clarity they need about their marriage . “ What ’ s pivotal here is , what was the agreement ? Did we agree to separate to work on ourselves for the purpose of coming back together again ? ” Winter said . “ Did we agree to separate and just be alone for a while and not have that discussion ? And in the second case , if you have an affair , sometimes it can bring you back to the original person . You can get whatever you need to achieve or gain a different perspective , allowing you to decide if you want to come back or leave for good. ” Will Smith y Jada Pinkett Smith ( Getty Images ) According to Lucas , some of the controversy surrounding Will and Jada ’ s relationship ties back to the 2022 Academy Awards - when the King Richard star jumped onto the stage and struck Rock across the face after the comedian made a joke about Jada ’ s shaved head , which is a result of her alopecia . “ Keep my wife ’ s name out of your f * * * ing mouth , ” Will yelled . Now that it ’ s been revealed the couple was separated at the time , Lucas questioned Will ’ s behaviour and word choice during the awards ceremony . “ That ’ s a weird reaction to have somebody who you ’ ve been broken up with for six years , you know ? So , were they really broken up or is Jada saying that as an attention-seeking thing ? ” he asked . However , Winter still believes the controversial incident speaks different volumes about the work Will has put into his relationship .",

    "There ’ s something going on with AI startups in France In just a few months , dozens of French entrepreneurs have turned their focus to AI Last night , Motier Ventures held a tech meetup focused on AI startups featuring some of the most hyped tech startups in the French tech ecosystem : Dust , Finegrain , Gladia , Mistral AI and Scenario — all of them are portfolio companies of Motier Ventures . And you could feel a sense of excitement both onstage and in the audience . Artificial intelligence , just like in the U.S. , has quickly become a buzzy vertical within the French tech industry . But this time , France seems particularly well positioned to become one of the main AI hubs of the world . And it shouldn ’ t come as a surprise . Tech giants have historically set up AI research labs in Paris , as there ’ s a large talent pool of PhD students in math , computer science and engineering . They usually graduate from Polytechnique , ENS or Inria . They sometimes move to the U.S. for postdoctoral research and then move back to France to join a research lab . For instance , Facebook ( now Meta ) created its Paris research lab back in 2015 with Yann LeCun at the helm of the AI initiative — this research group is called FAIR , for Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research . Google followed suit with its own AI research center dedicated to AI in Paris . “ The FAIR team is extremely impressive . Just look at what they ’ ve done with Llama , ” an entrepreneur told me yesterday . He recently had a private meeting with some of the engineers and scientists working on AI projects . And if you look at the founders of Mistral AI , the French AI startup working on open source large language models that raised a €105 million seed round ( $ 112 million at today ’ s exchange rate ) , all three co-founders ( Arthur Mensch , Timothée Lacroix and Guillaume Lample ) previously worked at Google ’ s DeepMind or FAIR . Last night , Mistral ’ s co-founders put together a demo of Mistral AI in a ChatGPT-like interface called Mistral AI Chat . The demo was based on a new model called “ mistral-70b-instruct-alpha01 , ” indicating that the team is actively working on a new model with more parameters so that it can be more competitive with sophisticated LLMs . According to a recent report from The Information , Mistral AI plans to raise as much as $ 300 million in the coming weeks . Mistral isn ’ t the only high-profile AI company in France . Poolside , a company that recently raised a $ 126 million seed round , plans to use AI to make it drastically easier to write code .",
    "as much as $ 300 million in the coming weeks . Mistral isn ’ t the only high-profile AI company in France . Poolside , a company that recently raised a $ 126 million seed round , plans to use AI to make it drastically easier to write code . Co-founded by Jason Warner , the former CTO of GitHub , and Eiso Kant , a serial entrepreneur who worked on Athenian and source { d } , the company has picked Paris as its home base . Dust , a company that is working on integrating large language models with internal corporate data from GitHub , Notion or Slack , also took the stage for a demo last night . At Dust ’ s office warming party , I realized that Dust shares its beautiful office building with Nabla , another French AI startup focused on helping doctors leverage large language models and co-founded by former FAIR engineers . This proves once again that an AI ecosystem is emerging . The founders of Mistral AI and Dust had to leave the meetup quickly after their demos as they were both invited for dinner at the Elysée Palace , the residence of Emmanuel Macron . So there ’ s also some public support for AI startups in France . An entrepreneur recently told me that multiple AI startups are working together on public tenders for government grants worth millions of euros as part of France 2030 . One thing that might differentiate European AI startups from AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic is that they ’ re thinking about regulation and compliance from day one . An interesting French AI startup in this field is Giskard , which is developing an open source testing framework , or “ the best LLM antivirus in the market , ” as Giskard co-founder and CEO Alex Combessie told me . I ’ ll have more to write about Giskard in the coming days . And another wave of stealth AI startups Earlier this week , The Information reported that Adaptive , an AI startup based in Amsterdam and co-founded by French AI researcher Julien Launay , was about to raise a seed around at a $ 100 million valuation . Adaptive helps companies iterate on their AI applications without relying on external data or annotations . A source confirmed that Index Ventures is leading the Adaptive round , with Iconiq and Motier Ventures participating . Another source told me that Index Ventures is also leading a seed round for an AI startup with a team split between Paris and London . In other news , I ’ ve heard that Steeve Morin , a key member of the team behind Zenly , a popular consumer app that was acquired by Snap , is also creating an AI startup called ZML . The team will focus on improving machine learning inference and other low-level tools .",
    "I ’ ve heard that Steeve Morin , a key member of the team behind Zenly , a popular consumer app that was acquired by Snap , is also creating an AI startup called ZML .

Maxime Germain , the founder of mental health startup Jour , which was acquired by Alan , is leaving Alan to start Heart Hands , an AI startup that is developing a “ second brain in your pocket , ” as an investor described it to me . Pierre Valade , the founder of Sunrise and Jumbo , is putting together a team for an AI startup currently called Chief of Staff . Hugo Mercier is working on an AI startup in stealth mode as well . I think it ’ s safe to call this new wave of startups a trend . While the overall tech ecosystem is still experiencing a downturn , there ’ s an absurd amount of activity among French startups at the early stage with new AI startups getting founded at a rapid pace and VC firms fighting for the most competitive funding rounds .",
    "European Union regulators have sent Amazon a formal statement of objections setting out competition concerns over its proposed acquisition of robot vacuum maker , iRobot . The step does not confirm the EU will seek to block the deal but it shows antitrust regulators do remain concerned . It could therefore push Amazon to offer remedies to EU authorities to settle the investigation and avoid the risk of the acquisition being blocked . Amazon has already lowered its acquisition price for iRobot — which was originally an all-cash offer of $ 1.7 billion back in August 2022 — by 15 % owing to increased debt taken on by its target while regulatory snags delayed closing the deal at the original purchase price . The bloc has been closely scrutinizing the Amazon-iRobot deal since July when the EU announced its in-depth probe . The Commission said at the time it was worried the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners ( RVCs ) and strengthen its position as online marketplace provider in a number of ways . Today ’ s announcement by the EU , following several months of in-depth examination looking at how the transaction might impact competition , lays out formal concerns for Amazon to respond to . The EU ’ s objections focus on foreclosure risks . The EU says its concerns focus on whether the deal will give Amazon the ability and incentive to foreclose iRobot ’ s rivals by deploying strategies aimed at preventing competitors from selling RVCs on Amazon ’ s marketplace and/or making it harder for them to do so — such as by delisting rival products ; reducing their visibility in both non-paid ( i.e . organic ) and paid results ( i.e . ads ) displayed on its marketplace ; limiting their access to certain widgets it operates ( such as the “ other products you may like ” feature ) or “ certain commercially-attractive product labels ” ( e.g . ‘ Amazon ’ s choice ’ or ‘ Works With Alexa ’ ) ; and/or by directly or indirectly raising the costs of iRobot ’ s rivals to advertise and sell their RVCs on its marketplace . “ Amazon may have the ability to foreclose iRobot ’ s rivals because Amazon ’ s online marketplace is a particularly important channel to sell RVCs in France , Germany , Italy , and Spain , ” the Commission writes in a press release . “ RVC customers in these countries particularly rely on Amazon both in terms of product discovery as well as for their final purchasing decision. ” The Commission is also worried Amazon may have the incentive to foreclose iRobot ’ s rivals because it may be economically profitable for it to do so ."
